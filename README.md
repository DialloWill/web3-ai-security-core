# 🛡️ Web3 AI Security Core

Building an AI-powered security platform to protect creators, users, and protocols in Web3.

> Codename: TBD  
> Phase I — Threat Detection • Smart Contract Scanning • Creator Safety

---

## 💡 Vision

This project exists to secure the decentralized world. We're designing tools that:
- 🔍 Detect vulnerabilities in smart contracts using AI
- 🛡️ Help creators mint safely and transparently
- 🧠 Equip users with real-time risk insights

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Python** — AI logic, backend, scripting
- **Flask / FastAPI** — Lightweight web framework
- **Web3.py** — Interact with smart contracts/blockchain
- **OpenAI / HuggingFace** — AI/NLP tools for scanning logic
- **Zora / Lens APIs** — Integrations (future phase)

---

## 📁 Structure (Coming Soon)

/backend → AI & blockchain logic (smart contract scans)
/frontend → (Later) creator dashboard UI
/docs → Research notes, architecture diagrams
/scripts → Python CLI tools for security testing

## 🧪 Current Status
🚧 Planning & Foundation Phase  
✅ GitHub setup  
🔜 AI scan prototype (Phase I)
